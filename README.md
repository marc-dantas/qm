## Customization
I highly encourage you to take a look at the source code and modify it as you want.

At the top of the source code there are some configuration constants that you would like to
modify to your needs. 

## Tutorial
Use `[W]` and `[S]` to navigate up or down, respectively.

Use `[D]` to go into the folder currently selected.

Use `[A]` to go back (the same as going into `..` directory)

Press `[H]` to show Help message.
